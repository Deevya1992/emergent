<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user's final and overriding request is to rebuild the entire Deaxautt website using only pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. This new version must be a completely static website with no build process or server-side dependencies.

The website must be an enterprise-grade IT services and digital marketing site with over 30 pages. All content, assets, and functionality from the previously built React version should be migrated to this new static HTML/CSS/JS version.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- The website must be a static build (HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery only).
- It must be deployable via simple file upload (to cPanel, Nginx, etc.).
- All navigation, including the service dropdown menu, must work correctly.
- All service pages must have unique, dedicated content.
- The Our Journey timeline on the About page should match the user-provided reference image.
- **Required Services (Individual pages for each):**
    - **IT Services:** Website Development (Static, Dynamic, CMS, E-commerce), Mobile App Development (Android, iOS, Cross-platform), Software Development (Custom, SaaS, Enterprise), UI/UX Design, Cloud & DevOps, Maintenance & Support.
    - **Digital Marketing Services:** SEO, PPC / Google Ads, Social Media Marketing, Content Marketing, Email Marketing, Branding, Performance Marketing.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend has been built. This application was later converted into a static React build (). All the necessary content, images, and logic are present within this React application structure. The backend and database are now considered deprecated due to the user's pivot to a pure static site.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent acknowledged the user's request to rebuild the entire website using HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery. It began the process by identifying the assets available from the previous React build and was about to create the new core  file for the static version.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  Issue 1:  (P0) The entire website needs to be rebuilt from scratch using HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery, abandoning the existing React framework.

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1:
     - Attempted fixes: The previous implementation used React, which the user has now rejected.
     - Next debug checklist: This is a feature implementation, not a bug fix. The agent needs to start creating the HTML structure for the home page () and the associated CSS (), porting content and styles from the existing React components.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a mandatory pivot requested by the user. The goal is to deliver a framework-less static website that meets the user's deployment requirements.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? Y/N: N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  Task 1:  (P0) Rebuild the Deaxautt website using pure HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery.

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1:
     - Where to resume: The agent has analyzed the existing assets. The next step is to create  and  and begin building the Home page, translating the content and structure from .
     - What will be achieved with this? A complete, framework-less static website as per the user's final request.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on something: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no upcoming tasks beyond the complete rebuild of the website in HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery. All previous plans are now obsolete.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-Stack Application Development:** Built a comprehensive 30+ page website with a React frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend.
- **Content & Asset Integration:** Integrated user-provided logos, contact information, and business details across the entire site.
- **Critical Bug Fix:** Repaired the main navigation's Services dropdown menu, which was flickering and unusable. The fix involved using controlled React state and proper event handlers.
- **UI Redesign:** Re-designed the Our Journey timeline on the About page to match a user-provided visual reference.
- **Static Site Conversion:** Converted the React application into a fully static build, including creating an  file for routing.

npm@10.8.2 /usr/lib/node_modules/npm dependency conflicts:
    1.  Resolved a  version mismatch with .
    2.  Resolved a  v19 incompatibility with  by upgrading the latter to v9.
- **Audits & Verification:** Performed multiple audits to verify that all service pages contained unique content, refuting user claims of content duplication.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All issues raised by the user during the session were addressed and resolved or proven to be non-issues after investigation.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - No issue recurrence was noted from a previous fork.

**Code Architecture**
The current (but now deprecated) architecture is a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The agent needs to create a new, flat static site structure.

**Existing (Source) Architecture:**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Previous:** React, FastAPI, MongoDB, Shadcn UI, .
- **Current/Going Forward:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), jQuery.

**key DB schema**
The following MongoDB models were created but are now **deprecated**:
- ****: {uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , , , , , , }
- ****: {uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , Sat Jan 17 17:04:48 UTC 2026, }
- ****: {uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , , }
- ****: {uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , }
- ****: {, , , , , }

**changes in tech stack**
Complete pivot from a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack to a pure static site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

**All files of reference**
- : **CRITICAL FILE.** Contains all unique content for services, testimonials, case studies, etc., that must be ported to the new static HTML files.
- : All  files in the pages directory serve as the structural and content reference for their corresponding new  files.
- : Reference for the navigation structure, including the fixed dropdown menu logic which needs to be replicated in jQuery/JS.
- : Reference for the footer content.
-  & : Contain base styles and theme variables that can be adapted for the new .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The entire project is being refactored from a React SPA into a multi-page static HTML website.

**key api endpoints**
All backend API endpoints are now **deprecated**. The contact form will need to be changed to a  link or a third-party form service.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The user has mandated a complete technology stack change. You **must not** continue working on the React application. Your task is to rebuild the entire website from scratch using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. All necessary content and assets are available in the existing  directory, particularly in  and the  components. The logic for the fixed services dropdown menu in  must be carefully replicated using jQuery/JS. The backend is no longer in use.
